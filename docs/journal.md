# Project Journal

## Project Principles

1. Build in layers.
2. Every artifact must earn its place.
3. Make the smallest possible change.
4. Commit only working states.
5. Understand before automating.

# Layer 0 - Project Foundation

**Date:** 2026-07-06

## Goal

Create a clean project foundation for building Cisco Modeling Labs on AWS using Terraform.

## Accomplishments

- Created the GitHub repository.
- Established the initial project structure.
- Created and activated a Python virtual environment.
- Configured Git and pushed the initial repository.
- Verified Terraform installation.
- Verified AWS CLI installation.
- Verified AWS authentication using the `cml_terraform` IAM user.

# Layer 1 - Terraform Foundation

## Why

Terraform cannot create infrastructure until it knows:

- Which Terraform version this project supports.
- Which providers it needs.
- Which inputs are available.

---

## Goal

Initialize Terraform and validate the configuration.

---

## Artifacts

### versions.tf

Terraform needs this file to know which Terraform and provider versions this project supports.

### providers.tf

Terraform needs this file to know which cloud provider to communicate with.

### variables.tf

Terraform needs this file so configuration values can be reused instead of hard-coded.

### .terraform.lock.hcl

Terraform generated this file to ensure everyone uses the same provider versions.

---

## Validation

- `terraform init`
- `terraform validate`

---

## Lessons Learned

- Terraform works from the current directory.
- `terraform init` prepares the project.
- `terraform validate` verifies configuration before planning.
- `.terraform/` is local state and should not be committed.
- `.terraform.lock.hcl` should be committed.

---

## 🎓 If I Had to Teach This Today...

Terraform needs three things before it can do anything:

1. Which version of Terraform the project supports.
2. Which provider it should use.
3. Any input variables needed by that provider.

Until those exist, Terraform doesn't know enough to build infrastructure.

---

## Ready for Next Layer?

Yes.

Terraform now knows what it is.

Next, it needs to learn who it is talking to.
